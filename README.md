# SITA ASSIGNMENT
Assignment has done as web application and written in pure frontend languages such HTML5, CSS and JavaScript.

In order to access the app either you can go https://assignment-sita.netlify.com address via any browser. This is the easiest way to access the app because in local restrictions of xml file usage might be problem on using. In order to try on local you can use Safari browser. In order to overcome restriction you need to turn on develop menu and click on Disable File Restrictions and then index.html will execute correctly. 

When you open the app you will see buttons and table scheme. Buttons are the main functions of the app and here crucial information about working principles of them:

Load & List XML : This button/function access the all xml files and list them in a table.
Parcel x1: This function works by making conditional comparison and rules in order to parse the data to the correct department. It will work by clicking until end of the xml. This process could be done in autonomously but I preferred this to show the process of each time data separation. So you need to click as many as in the list above to make parsing. 
      Also this function makes dynamical assigning for the department and its values.
3.   Call Department: After all data parsed to its department you can call any of departments by its name such mail, regular, heavy and insurance so it will be visible which department keeps which information.
4.   Add Department: This function creates new dynamical array/object. Even though department needs rules. This step only creates department with its own names.
5.   Delete Department: This function removes the data and its own values inside of it. After removing the showing screen will be fade away and in order to check if its removed you can call the department by its name.

So far application works as this statements. I highly recommend by using the web address I mentioned app there.
